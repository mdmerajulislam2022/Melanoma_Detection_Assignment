# Melanoma Detection via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
###### The objective of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify a dermoscopic image of a skin lesion as Melanoma or Non-Melanoma. A dermoscopic image is a picture of the skin using a microscope and illumination.
## Motivation
###### Melanoma is the deadliest and most aggressive form of skin cancer; it is projected that in 2018, Melanoma of the skin will cause 9,320 deaths in the United States. However, if Melanoma is caught in an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is about 99%. Therefore, the early detection of Melanoma, before metastasis, is critical for patient survival.
